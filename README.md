**Really the Robot**, taking Sallie for a Ride...

No AGI can develop fully without a vessel in the 'real world' that will embody it. **Really the Robot** will be that body, which will be developed into a kit for people to experiment with. All software and documentation will be stored here. 

This project is the collection of software components that enable Really the Robot to come alive, and use an instance of Charles J. Simon's Brain Simulator II program. As it develops, Brain Simulator II will grow and learn along with it, but the software in this project is more of a technical nature: it will perform low level control functions, communication of the 'mindlink' that allows the PC to be the 'brain in the basement' for the robot itself, and any local functionality that is required for the robot to function. Various test programs and tools will also be stored here. 

Currently, this project is still in an embryonic state, with Charlie and me tossing ideas to one another. But seeing both our enthusiasm, I don't doubt this will soon start growing, probably exponentially like every computer related phenomenon!

Thanks for your interest in this project!

Andr√© Slabber, desgner/engineer of the robot project.
