# RoboControl
This Arduino program runs on the Arduino Mega 2560 that controls Really the Robot. It will get more functionality over time, but right now we will start with the following:

- A function to control one OmniWheel through its driver board and a single PWM control pin.
- Functions to control four of those wheel in unison, for precise navigation.
- The mobile side of the communication link to the second Arduino that is driven by the PC.
